Currently I am a postdoc at the University of Penn in the Biology Department. There are two things I enjoy about being a marine scientist. First is the sheer amount of knowledge the ocean holds. It gives me countless opportunities to learn and explore. Second, I physically enjoy being underwater. there is something about being totally submerged in water that is calming. I got involved in #BlackinMarineScientist because I love being Black and I believe it is important that we highlight Black stories as a way to combat anti-Blackness.
