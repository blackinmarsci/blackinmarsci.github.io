										<p><i>Favorite Publication</i>: Abdel-Raheem & Allen (2019) <a href = "https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/706607">Developmental Consequences of Temperature and Salinity Stress in the Sand Dollar <i>Dendraster excentricus</i>.</a></p>
									<p>Salma Abdel-Raheem is the Sightings Network Coordinator at The Whale Museum in Friday Harbor, WA.</p>
									<p>In the paper above, Abdel-Raheem & Allen  highlight the work of <a href ="https://biosciences.uchicago.edu/diversity/ee-just">E.E. Just</a> from the early 1900s, who was the only African American developmental biologist that Abdel-Raheem came across in her literature review. He was one of two researchers who described the potential for the developmental phenomena that Abdel-Raheem studied for her undergraduate honors thesis. Mentions of his work was virtually absent in the modern literature - something that likely would not have been the case if he were a white researcher. </p>
									<p>“Tough times don’t last, tough people do.” Lately I’ve been feeling like the tough times are never-ending and so it’s a good reminder to persevere. Finding a community would definitely help make people tougher than the times.</p>

										<p><i>Favorite Publication</i>: Wright, D.J. (2017) <a href = "https://tos.org/oceanography/assets/docs/30-2_wright.pdf">Swells, soundings, and sustainability, but... here be monsters.</a></p>
										<p>After 17 years as a professor of geography and oceanography at Oregon State University Dr. Dawn Wright was appointed Chief Scientist of the Environmental Systems Research Institute (aka “Esri”), a world-leading geographic information system (GIS) software, services and R&D company in October 2011. As chief scientist of Esri, Dawn works directly with the CEO on strengthening the scientific foundation for Esri software and services, while also representing Esri to the national/international scientific community, especially in ocean science. She maintains an affiliated faculty appointment within the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State.</p>

<p>Dawn has authored or co-authored over 170 articles and 12 books on seafloor mapping, coastal/ocean informatics, geographic information science, as well as widely-read perspective pieces on deep ocean mapping, conservation, and environmental education. She has participated in over 20 oceanographic research expeditions throughout the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Southern Oceans. In 1991 she became the first African-American female to dive to the deep ocean floor in a deep submersible (1.5 miles deep to the crest of the East Pacific Rise). Visit her on the web at <a href="dusk.geo.orst.edu">https://dusk.geo.orst.edu</a>.</p>
									<p>"As per what Coach Don Haskins said to his Texas Western basketball players, in the film <a href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385726/">Glory Road</a>: “Shut them up! … [Get in the game, stay in the game, Win!] Your coaches and teammates are here for you!"</p>

									<p>Rayna Nolen (she/her/hers) is currently studying the abundance (in water, biota and sediments) and effects of different persistent chemical pollutants (PFASs, PAHs, PCBs, Dioxins) in Galveston Bay as a Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University at Galveston. She has loved the ocean and had a passion for conservation for as long as she can remember. She hopes to inspire the next generation of scientists to follow their dreams and fight for what they believe in, even when times get hard or they feel like giving up. </p>

									<p>"The ocean isn’t what separated us, it’s what connects us to each other and to nature.” </p>
									<p>“She believes the first step in conservation is breaking the myth that humans are separate from nature; humans play a key role in every ecosystem. She aspires to reconnect people with nature by saving the world, one ocean at a time, with one conversation at a time."</p>

									<h2>Dr. Dijanna Figueroa</h2>
									</header>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="profiles/DijannaFigueroa_boat.png" alt="Dr. Dijanna Figueroa working with young students on a boat" /></span>Dijanna Figueroa has made a career of exploring the mysteries of the deep. Dr. Figueroa holds a bachelor’s degree in Marine Biology from UCLA and a PhD in Marina Science from UC Santa Barbara. She was featured in James Cameron’s documentary <a href ="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417415/">Aliens of the Deep</a>, which follows Cameron and NASA scientists as they explore the some of the deepest parts of the ocean and learn about the unique life forms that inhabit those spaces. Her research on the thermal physiology of hydrothermal vent animals was featured in the film. Recently, Figueroa has become an advocate for STEAM education—adding art and design to the science, technology, engineering, and math equation. She’s spent more than two decades teaching STEAM to grades K–8, formerly served as global director of the <a href = "https://www.museschool.org/programs/steam">Muse School</a> National Geographic Society’s Green STEAM program and has advisory roles with many STEM/STEAM nonprofits. She was recently featured on MTV’s Women Crush Wednesdays Women in STEM series. She currently teaches middle school science at <a href = "https://www.stmatthewsschool.com/">St. Matthew's Parish School</a> and runs programs that teach students how to fly drones, scuba dive and build underwater robots. If that isn’t enough, Figueroa is the director of the <a href = "https://www.lucasscholars.org/">Lucas Scholars STEM program</a>, a community based social justice and equity program designed to engage young people in science, engineering, design, and art. She loves the ocean and is committed to making ocean science accessible to all people.</p>
