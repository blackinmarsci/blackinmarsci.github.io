										<h2>Josette E.T. McLean</h2>
										</header>
										<span class="image right"><img src="profiles/JosetteMcLean.jpeg" alt="Josette stands in front of her scientific poster" /></span>
										<p><i>Favorite Publication</i>: Brandl et al. (2020) <a href = "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17731-2">Extreme environmental conditions reduce coral reef fish biodiversity and productivity.</a></p>
										<p>Josette is a Master's Candidate at Hampton University in the department of Marine and Environmental Science.
 
As a marine ecologist  she is interested in increasing the resilience of  coastal marine ecosystems  (e.g. corals, mangroves, seagrasses) to anthropogenic and climate change induced stressors (e.g. ocean acidification, sea level rise, and physical disturbances).
</p>
									<p>"I love marine science because there are so many aspects of the ocean that are yet to be discovered. I love that  ocean because it is one thing that connects us all as fellow inhabitants of planet earth. I love this field because the career, internship and research opportunities are virtually limitless."</p>

										<h2>Nicola Smith</h2>

												<span class="image left"><img src="profiles/NicolaSmith.JPG" alt="Nicola on a boat" /></span>
										<p><i>Favorite Publication</i>: Smith & Côté (2019) <a href = "https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2573">Multiple drivers of contrasting diversity-invasibility relationships at fine spatial grains.</a></p>
									<p>Nicola Smith is a postdoctoral research fellow at Simon Fraser University in BC, Canada. She studies biological invasions in the oceans, particularly on coral reefs.</p>
									<p>"The journey to becoming a marine scientist is long and hard, but it is also fun and rewarding if you're open to new experiences. Plus, the best part is that you rack up a lot of odd skills and bizarre field stories that make great ice breaker comments at events where you feel out of place."</p>

											<h2>Colin Howe</h2>
										</header>
										<span class="image right"><img src="profiles/ColinHowe.jpeg" alt="Colin with palm trees in the background" /></span>
										<p><i>Favorite Publication</i>: Willis et al. (2006) <a href = "https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.37.091305.110136">The role of hybridization in the Evolution of Reef Corals.</a></p>
									<p>Colin Howe (he/him/his) is a tropical marine ecologist, primarily focused on Caribbean corals. Colin has studied, lived, and worked in the Florida Keys, Bonaire, and US Virgin Islands. With both parents from the Caribbean, Colin’s passion for marine science stems not only from a fascination with the ocean, but also a cultural connection to the Caribbean. Colin has recently joined Dr. Medina’s lab at Penn State University to pursue a Ph.D. in coral microbiology. His Ph.D. will focus on the coral microbiome and how endosymbionts and endolithic algal communities influence coral physiology.</p>
									<p>"Decide not to be a slave to your limitations, but rather choose to be the master of your own possibilities." - Josette Howe (aka Mom)</p>

									<p>"As per what Coach Don Haskins said to his Texas Western basketball players, in the film <a href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385726/">Glory Road</a>: “Shut them up! … [Get in the game, stay in the game, Win!] Your coaches and teammates are here for you!"</p>

									<p>Rayna Nolen (she/her/hers) is currently studying the abundance (in water, biota and sediments) and effects of different persistent chemical pollutants (PFASs, PAHs, PCBs, Dioxins) in Galveston Bay as a Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University at Galveston.. She has loved the ocean and had a passion for conservation for as long as she can remember.She hopes to inspire the next generation of scientists to follow their dreams and fight for what they believe in, even when times get hard or they feel like giving up. </p>

									<p>"The ocean isn’t what separated us, it’s what connects us to each other and to nature.” </p>
									<p>“She believes the first step in conservation is breaking the myth that humans are separate from nature; humans play a key role in every ecosystem. She aspires to reconnect people with nature by saving the world, one ocean at a time, with one conversation at a time."</p>

									<h2>Dr. Dijanna Figueroa</h2>
									</header>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="profiles/DijannaFigueroa_boat.png" alt="Dr. Dijanna Figueroa working with young students on a boat" /></span>Dijanna Figueroa has made a career of exploring the mysteries of the deep. Dr. Figueroa holds a bachelor’s degree in Marine Biology from UCLA and a PhD in Marina Science from UC Santa Barbara. She was featured in James Cameron’s documentary <a href ="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417415/">Aliens of the Deep</a>, which follows Cameron and NASA scientists as they explore the some of the deepest parts of the ocean and learn about the unique life forms that inhabit those spaces. Her research on the thermal physiology of hydrothermal vent animals was featured in the film. Recently, Figueroa has become an advocate for STEAM education—adding art and design to the science, technology, engineering, and math equation. She’s spent more than two decades teaching STEAM to grades K–8, formerly served as global director of the <a href = "https://www.museschool.org/programs/steam">Muse School</a> National Geographic Society’s Green STEAM program and has advisory roles with many STEM/STEAM nonprofits. She was recently featured on MTV’s Women Crush Wednesdays Women in STEM series. She currently teaches middle school science at <a href = "https://www.stmatthewsschool.com/">St. Matthew's Parish School</a> and runs programs that teach students how to fly drones, scuba dive and build underwater robots. If that isn’t enough, Figueroa is the director of the <a href = "https://www.lucasscholars.org/">Lucas Scholars STEM program</a>, a community based social justice and equity program designed to engage young people in science, engineering, design, and art. She loves the ocean and is committed to making ocean science accessible to all people.</p>
