									<span class="image right"><img src="profiles/DanielleMcHaskell.jpg" alt="Danielle's Headshot" /></span>
									 <p><i>Favorite Publication</i>: Kaplanis et al, R.W. et al. (2016) <a href="https://scholarworks.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context=vimsbooks">Distribution Patterns of the non-native seaweeds Sargassum horneri (Turner) C. Agardh and Undaria pinnatifida (Harvey) Suringar on the San Diego and Pacific coast of North America.</a></p>
									<p>Danielle is a 2nd year PhD student in Dr. Jennifer Smith's lab. She is interested in understanding how invasive seaweeds may impact community dynamics and what mechanisms allow for invasion success in temperate ecosystems. Currently, she is exploring what role non-native seaweeds Undaria pinnatifida and Sargassum horneri may play in the biodiversity and abundance of native species in California. </p>
									<p>"Know your worth": Some people may try to talk over you. Some people may try to exclude you. Some people will not be able to see what an asset you are but know that whatever room you enter, you are there because you add value to that space. Ensure that you build a supportive community that will help you build your confidence in your intrinsic value and lift you up. </p>

										<h2>Tiffany Crawford</h2>
										</header>
										<span class="image left"><img src="profiles/TiffanyCrawford.jpg" alt="Tiffany's headshot" /></span>
										<p><i>Favorite Publication</i>: Diaz, R.J. & Solow, A. (1999) <a href = "http://aquaticcommons.org/14642/">Ecological and economic consequences of hypoxia: Topic 2 Report for the Integrated Assessment on Hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico</a></p>
										<p>Tiffany Crawford grew up in Pikesville, Maryland, and developed a fascination with the ocean, and all things marine at an early age.  Tiffany’s parents supported and strongly encouraged her pursuit of a career as a marine biologist, and in becoming the first “female Jacques Cousteau”.
Tiffany earned a bachelor’s degree in marine science at Coastal Carolina University and a master’s degree in environmental policy at Drexel University.  While at Coastal, Tiffany gained her open water certification for SCUBA diving. Tiffany’s education and research experience helped to refine her career goals and shift her focus from ocean exploration to ocean conservation.
Tiffany officially began her career as an environmental scientist with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2002. During her 18 year career at EPA, Tiffany has worked in on a variety of water quality projects and regulations including the development and state adoption of numeric water quality standards for the Chesapeake Bay, state implementation of the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act, and carried leading and key roles in high priority issues like the Numeric Nutrient Criteria Development for Florida Waters, and the 2015 Clean Water Rule.
Seeking additional opportunities for growth and development, in 2019 Tiffany served as a Brookings LEGIS Fellow in the office of United States Senator Mazie K. Hirono, where her knowledge and skills were broadly applied at the congressional level. During this time, she also gained first-hand knowledge of congressional operations; including oversight of the executive branch.
Now back at EPA, Tiffany serves as a water policy advisor on matters of agency and congressional oversight.
 Tiffany remains an avid SCUBA diver, and constantly seeks new opportunities to expand her reach as an ocean advocate.
