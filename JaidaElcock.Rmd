I am a shark scientist at the University of Washington’s School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences (SAFS). I am interested in the movement ecology of migratory elasmobranchs, as this information can be incredibly useful in conservation efforts but is unknown for many species. I enjoy marine science because it allows me to keep asking and answering questions about the animals I am fascinated with. Additionally, I have always been drawn to the water, so the fact that I now have the opportunity to work in ocean systems is extremely exciting! I decided to get involved with #BlackInMarineScienceWeek because I have noticed throughout my life that there isn’t much representation of people like me in the field. Black children deserve to see themselves represented in the jobs they aspire to, otherwise they may never realize that this could be an opportunity for them. I want to help pave the way for other kids and young adults to feel welcomed, comfortable, and happy in the field of marine science. I believe that science is a place for everyone, so let’s put in the effort to make that statement feel true.
