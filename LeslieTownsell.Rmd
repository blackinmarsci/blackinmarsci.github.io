I’m a graduate student in the Marine Science Department at the University of Georgia. I am currently studying the impacts of climate change on oyster aquaculture along the coast of Georgia. What’s not to enjoy about marine science, you get to have a career that people usually dream about! I’m a water baby so anything that involves water whether it’s research or sports you can always count me in. I love being in, around, or on the water. I love eI’m involved in #blackinmarinescienceweek because I want to shed light on the lack of diversity in the field and inspire other black women and girls to take up space in this predominantly white field. I want to  break down barriers and pave the way to make it a little easier for those black girls following in my footsteps.
