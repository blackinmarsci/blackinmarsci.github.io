I am a PhD student in Ecology at UC Davis. My research explores the effects of climate change on shellfish aquaculture in California. Specifically, I am working with the Hog Island and Tomales Bay Oyster Companies to determine whether pre-conditioning the commercially farmed Pacific Oyster to elevated seawater temperatures improves the species’ resistance to disease outbreaks. I am an active science communicator and am deeply invested in improving the accessibility of marine science and amplifying underrepresented voices -- which is why I’m thrilled to be supporting #BlackInMarineScienceWeek!!!
