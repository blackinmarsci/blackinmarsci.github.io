I am a shark conservationist and marine turtle specialist in south Florida. I recently graduated with my Masterâ€™s degree in marine biology from Nova Southeastern University. My research focused on the effects of feeding tourism on nurse sharks in Belize, emphasizing changes in behavior, habituation and abundance. I am also a co-founder of Minorities in Shark Science (MISS), an organization focused on amplifying underrepresented voices and increasing the diversity in shark science. I enjoy marine science because there are so many mind blowing things related to marine environments and marine life. I am participating in #BlackinMarineScience week because I want to help amplify the black voices in this field and give them the credit and exposure they deserve.
