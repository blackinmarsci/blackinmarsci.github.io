										<p>"As a child my grandfather and grandmother were both fishers. They played a major role in raising me and introducing me to the sea, fish and fishing. As a young high school teen, I enrolled in the Job training program and signed up to be placed at the Department of Fisheries and Marine Resources, more than 20 years later I am still here. I have been the Director of Fisheries since 2014, leading a dynamic team in achieving coastal resilience, species protection and public education and sensitization. I do not have a favorite quote, but, I am a strong believer in education and stewardship being the most effective tools for environmental protection".</p>

									<p>Colin Howe (he/him/his) is a tropical marine ecologist, primarily focused on Caribbean corals. Colin has studied, lived, and worked in the Florida Keys, Bonaire, and US Virgin Islands. With both parents from the Caribbean, Colin’s passion for marine science stems not only from a fascination with the ocean, but also a cultural connection to the Caribbean. Colin has recently joined Dr. Medina’s lab at Penn State University to pursue a Ph.D. in coral microbiology. His Ph.D. will focus on the coral microbiome and how endosymbionts and endolithic algal communities influence coral physiology.</p>

									<h2>Dr. Dijanna Figueroa</h2>
									</header>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="profiles/DijannaFigueroa_boat.png" alt="Dr. Dijanna Figueroa working with young students on a boat" /></span>Dijanna Figueroa has made a career of exploring the mysteries of the deep. Dr. Figueroa holds a bachelor’s degree in Marine Biology from UCLA and a PhD in Marina Science from UC Santa Barbara. She was featured in James Cameron’s documentary <a href ="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417415/">Aliens of the Deep</a>, which follows Cameron and NASA scientists as they explore the some of the deepest parts of the ocean and learn about the unique life forms that inhabit those spaces. Her research on the thermal physiology of hydrothermal vent animals was featured in the film. Recently, Figueroa has become an advocate for STEAM education—adding art and design to the science, technology, engineering, and math equation. She’s spent more than two decades teaching STEAM to grades K–8, formerly served as global director of the <a href = "https://www.museschool.org/programs/steam">Muse School</a> National Geographic Society’s Green STEAM program and has advisory roles with many STEM/STEAM nonprofits. She was recently featured on MTV’s Women Crush Wednesdays Women in STEM series. She currently teaches middle school science at <a href = "https://www.stmatthewsschool.com/">St. Matthew's Parish School</a> and runs programs that teach students how to fly drones, scuba dive and build underwater robots. If that isn’t enough, Figueroa is the director of the <a href = "https://www.lucasscholars.org/">Lucas Scholars STEM program</a>, a community based social justice and equity program designed to engage young people in science, engineering, design, and art. She loves the ocean and is committed to making ocean science accessible to all people.</p>
