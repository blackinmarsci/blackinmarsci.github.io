										<p>Dr. Deidre Gibson is the Chair of the Department of Marine and Environmental Science at Hampton University.  She earned her B.S. in Oceanography from the University of Washington, Ph.D. in Marine Science from the University of Georgia/Skidaway Institute of Oceanography. She is a broadly trained biological oceanographer with research interests centered on the trophic ecology, reproductive biology, and population dynamics of zooplankton, but more specifically, gelatinous zooplankton, and currently oyster restoration. While at Hampton University, she has served as PI on several NSF and NOAA grants that continue to train the next generation of African American marine scientists.</p>
										<p>"The field of Marine Science provides many varied experiences,  take the blinders off and explore. You never know where you will end, but the journey will be amazing."</p>

										<p>"As a child my grandfather and grandmother were both fishers. They played a major role in raising me and introducing me to the sea, fish and fishing. As a young high school teen, I enrolled in the Job training program and signed up to be placed at the Department of Fisheries and Marine Resources, more than 20 years later I am still here. I have been the Director of Fisheries since 2014, leading a dynamic team in achieving coastal resilience, species protection and public education and sensitization. I do not have a favorite quote, but, I am a strong believer in education and stewardship being the most effective tools for environmental protection."</p>

									<p>Colin Howe (he/him/his) is a tropical marine ecologist, primarily focused on Caribbean corals. Colin has studied, lived, and worked in the Florida Keys, Bonaire, and US Virgin Islands. With both parents from the Caribbean, Colin’s passion for marine science stems not only from a fascination with the ocean, but also a cultural connection to the Caribbean. Colin has recently joined Dr. Medina’s lab at Penn State University to pursue a Ph.D. in coral microbiology. His Ph.D. will focus on the coral microbiome and how endosymbionts and endolithic algal communities influence coral physiology.</p>
