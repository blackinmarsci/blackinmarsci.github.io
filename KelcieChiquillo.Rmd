I am a Marine Biologist who studies #seagrass! I use multidisciplinary techniques to understand the evolutionary and ecological dynamics that influence marine invasions. More specifically, I work on a globally invasive seagrass and ask: how it arrived to the Caribbean, how it competes with other native #seagrasses and what are the #microbes associated with itâ€™s competition and invasion. I love learning about marine science and applying my knowledge as a newbie fly fishing angler! I love asking questions, travelling, and bringing new people into fishing and scuba diving. I am involved with #BlackInMarineScienceWeek, as an ally, to highlight all the excellent Black marine scientists across the world!!
